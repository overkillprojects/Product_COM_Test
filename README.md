# Product_COM_Test
Generic WPF/C# sketch for testing CDC applications

This is more or less what I whip up whenever I need to test USB CDC (VirtualCOM) applications.  This is modified from some client work that required some specific messaging with the device based on what was already present in the host application.  Since it's no fun trying to paste this into a terminal emulator (non-printable characters in particular) I just slapped this together in the typical style.  It has plenty of bugs, the functionality was just to get me through testing of my CDC implementation.  In other words, this code should only be used with serious modification specific to your applciation/device!

Enjoy!
